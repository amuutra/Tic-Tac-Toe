# Tic-Tac-Toe

Ideas I have for expanding this that I'm going to write down just in case:

* Option to play against AI, with difficulty levels
* Keep track of the score
* Maybe an animation or something when you win, currently the game just stops
* Maybe allow some graphics customization, because what if I want a yellow cross instead?
